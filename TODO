# IMPLEMENTATION

- 15s auto poll of notes, 60s auto poll of users, on tab change/out of focus (4th Chat)
- mobile responsive, showing fewer columns in mobile
- multiple tabs login? like whatsapp, use here?
- deploy

- all notes have been fetched, when we click on to edit some note, a new request must not go out to fetch these data again
- prefetch on login the users and the notes and dont send another request when the links are clicked
- useCallback & useMemo for the tables and the data, for the auto fetch, for re rendering only that note/user that was updated
- table virtualization

- fixing the useAxiosFetch hook to be able to fetch the different things from some shared code, too much duplication, diff default states etc.
- too much code repetition of useEffect calls, mounting, cleanup functions, 

# STUDY

- difference in hooks/context, when to use what
- useLocation()
- try catch flow in react
